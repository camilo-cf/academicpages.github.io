excerpt: 'Nowadays, aerial robotics and in general UAVs have been developed with a potential increase, due to their many applications in the area of security, tele informatics and military, among others. This paper presents the mathematical model, control and simulation in Matlab of a quadcopter, based on aerial robot AR Drone 2.0 from Parrot s company. In the first part of the work, a brief introduction to the unmanned aerial robotics is done and a state of art for specific applications with the AR Drone is presented. Subsequently, the mathematical model of the vehicle is developed in order to obtain the kinematic characterization and to design a control algorithm that allows the manipulation of this device. Finally, the algorithms are tested on a simulation conducted in Matlab and the outstanding test results are presented as well as the conclusions of the work performed. '

Nowadays, aerial robotics and in general UAVs have been developed with a potential increase, due to their many applications in the area of security, tele informatics and military, among others. This paper presents the mathematical model, control and simulation in Matlab of a quadcopter, based on aerial robot AR Drone 2.0 from Parrot s company. In the first part of the work, a brief introduction to the unmanned aerial robotics is done and a state of art for specific applications with the AR Drone is presented. Subsequently, the mathematical model of the vehicle is developed in order to obtain the kinematic characterization and to design a control algorithm that allows the manipulation of this device. Finally, the algorithms are tested on a simulation conducted in Matlab and the outstanding test results are presented as well as the conclusions of the work performed.
