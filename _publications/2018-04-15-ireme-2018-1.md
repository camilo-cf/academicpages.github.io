excerpt: 'Nowadays, the design phase of any mechatronic system is mandatory before the implementation and the construction of a prototype. In the design phase, it is crucial to minimize failures, without under-dimensioning, any drive system in the desired prototype, using different simulation tools to test the proposed design under varied conditions.In this paper, the design, the simulation, and the control of a holonomic or omnidirectional mobile robot are presented. The design approach consists of a mathematically based method. The obtained model is an approach of the studied mobile robot, that allows an approach to the system’s behaviour, to a testing platform, and to a simulator for the desired robot, including most of the innerrobot’s interactions. The main contributions of this paper are the presentation and the study case of a proposed structured methodology for the study of any mechatronic-robotic system.'

Nowadays, the design phase of any mechatronic system is mandatory before the implementation and the construction of a prototype. In the design phase, it is crucial to minimize failures, without under-dimensioning, any drive system in the desired prototype, using different simulation tools to test the proposed design under varied conditions.In this paper, the design, the simulation, and the control of a holonomic or omnidirectional mobile robot are presented. The design approach consists of a mathematically based method. The obtained model is an approach of the studied mobile robot, that allows an approach to the system’s behaviour, to a testing platform, and to a simulator for the desired robot, including most of the innerrobot’s interactions. The main contributions of this paper are the presentation and the study case of a proposed structured methodology for the study of any mechatronic-robotic system.
