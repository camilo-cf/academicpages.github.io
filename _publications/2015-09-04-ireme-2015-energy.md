excerpt: 'Nowadays, active suspension systems are more frequently used in the automotive industry, due to these mechanisms allowing to take advantage of the absorbed energy from the irregularity of the roads, transforming them into electrical energy. This paper presents the analysis of the suspension mechanism with energy regeneration of a car, analyzed implementing Matlab simulation software, where different tools like SimMechanics and Simulink were used, likewise the operation of the regeneration method and each of the components in the suspension model were visualized, comparing the proposed system with the traditional one, showing the differences in the quality and therefore the comfort offered by the automobile.'

Nowadays, active suspension systems are more frequently used in the automotive industry, due to these mechanisms allowing to take advantage of the absorbed energy from the irregularity of the roads, transforming them into electrical energy. This paper presents the analysis of the suspension mechanism with energy regeneration of a car, analyzed implementing Matlab simulation software, where different tools like SimMechanics and Simulink were used, likewise the operation of the regeneration method and each of the components in the suspension model were visualized, comparing the proposed system with the traditional one, showing the differences in the quality and therefore the comfort offered by the automobile.
