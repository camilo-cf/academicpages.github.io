excerpt: 'This work presents an approach to Assistive Robotics based in a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) on the Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), using a 6-DOF Robotic Arm, an Emotiv EPOC sensor and a Kinect camera. The proposed architecture has the objective of integrating different systems, with the aim of creating a robotic assistant for the disabled or movement restricted user, improving the life quality of those people. The robot assistance assignment is related with actions like pick and place, or feed and hold food for the user, etc. The proposed methods are based in image and signal processing, BCI decision making, localization of a target point, trajectory planning for the robot arm, and execution of the assistive task. The most remarkable results validate the proposed approach as a good integration method of different technologies for assistive robotics tasks.'

This work presents an approach to Assistive Robotics based in a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) on the Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), using a 6-DOF Robotic Arm, an Emotiv EPOC sensor and a Kinect camera. The proposed architecture has the objective of integrating different systems, with the aim of creating a robotic assistant for the disabled or movement restricted user, improving the life quality of those people. The robot assistance assignment is related with actions like pick and place, or feed and hold food for the user, etc. The proposed methods are based in image and signal processing, BCI decision making, localization of a target point, trajectory planning for the robot arm, and execution of the assistive task. The most remarkable results validate the proposed approach as a good integration method of different technologies for assistive robotics tasks.
