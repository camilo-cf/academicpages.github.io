2018-05-12	Control structure for a car-like robot using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms	Neural Computing and Applications	Cáceres Flórez, C.A., Rosário, J.M. & Amaya, D. Neural Comput & Applic (2018). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-018-3514-1	The idea of improving human’s life quality by making life more comfortable and easy is nowadays possible using current technologies and techniques to solve complex daily problems. The presented idea in this work proposes a control strategy for autonomous robotic systems, specifically car-like robots. The main objective of this work is the development of a reactive navigation controller by means of obstacles avoidance and position control to reach a desired position in an unknown environment. This research goal was achieved by the integration of potential fields and neuroevolution controllers. The neuro-evolutionary controller was designed using the (NEAT) algorithm “Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies” and trained using a designed training environment. The methodology used allowed the vehicle to reach a certain level of autonomy, obtaining a stable controller that includes kinematic and dynamic considerations. The obtained results showed significant improvements compared to the comparison work.	NN_GA_2018		https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00521-018-3514-1	
2016-04-10	Development and interaction of a virtual laboratory assisted and controlled by PLC	Entre Ciencia e Ingenieria vol 10 no 19	Hoy en dia el elemento basico en la industria es el PLC, cuya funcion principal es controlar los sistemas y procesos presentes en la industria. El uso de laboratorios virtuales en fases preliminares al completo montaje de las lineas de produccion resulta muy util para ahorrar dinero y tiempo. Se presenta la ventaja de poder tener los controladores y la logica secuencial ya funcionando en su gran mayoria, antes de tener el sistema completamente listo. este articulo presenta un desarrollo e implementacion de un ambiente virtual de una banda trasportadora en una cerveceria. A traves del protocolo OSC, el laboratorio virtual y el PLC, puede comunicarse y lograr una emulacion del sistema real en un ambiente virtual, donde el PLC ha sido programado como se haria para una industria.

2016-04-10	Approach to Assistive Robotics Based on an EEG Sensor and a 6-DoF Robotic Arm	International Review of Mechanical Engineering (IREME) 10	This work presents an approach to Assistive Robotics based in a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) on the Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), using a 6-DOF Robotic Arm, an Emotiv EPOC sensor and a Kinect camera. The proposed architecture has the objective of integrating different systems, with the aim of creating a robotic assistant for the disabled or movement restricted user, improving the life quality of those people. The robot assistance assignment is related with actions like pick and place, or feed and hold food for the user, etc. The proposed methods are based in image and signal processing, BCI decision making, localization of a target point, trajectory planning for the robot arm, and execution of the assistive task. The most remarkable results validate the proposed approach as a good integration method of different technologies for assistive robotics tasks.

2016-01-10	Design of a Bio-Inspired Equine Robot Prototype	International Review of Mechanical Engineering (IREME) 10	Bio-inspired design is a science field attempting to create different technological systems based on the nature, as for example the bio-sensors, bio-materials and bio-actuators. These last are a new category of the bio-inspired design trying to develop new locomotion systems for mobile robotics taking as reference the behavior of different animals, like reptiles, birds and mammals such as the case of the horse. The study of the horse anatomy has allowed to create quadruped robots, showing important advantages over common mobile robots. One of these advantages is the operation in different types of environments, considering that a great part of the earth s surface complicates the mobility of the robots based on wheels. In this way the present paper shows the design of a robot inspired to the behavior of the horse limb. In first place the design of a mathematical model of the horse skeleton and its muscles by using the Denavit-Hartenberg method was performed for further dynamic analysis. Once the dynamic analysis was done, the mechanical simulation with the zoometric data of Colombian horse of paso-fino type was elaborated by a CAD software known as SolidWorks, obtaining as a result the physical data related to the movement of the robot. The proposed design tries to conserve the proportion between biologic system and the bio-inspired robot, with the objective to achieve an optimum performance and similarity of mechanical develop, and its general structure.
