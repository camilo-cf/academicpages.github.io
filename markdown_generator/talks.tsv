Multi-tank fuzzy level controller system using Kinect	Conference Paper	Conference Paper	2012 IEEE Ninth Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics Conference (CERMA)	2012-11-19	Cuernavaca, Mexico	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6524599/	This paper presents the development of a level control system using 3D machine vision techniques based on a single level-detector sensor (Kinect), in an arrangement of three tanks. Using image processing algorithms, each one of the tanks is classified within the video sequence as well as each one of the depth measurements is averaged regarding the cross sectional area of the surface of the tanks. This information is used to control the filling level for each tank using a proportional fuzzy controller and a proportional-derivative fuzzy controller. Finally the performance of each controller is compared.
Design and construction of a prototype rehabilitation machine to hand and wrist	Conference Paper	Conference Paper	2013 II International Congress of Engineering Mechatronics and Automation (CIIMA)2013-10-23	Bogot√°, Colombia	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6682785/	This conference paper presents the development of a machine for upper limb rehabilitation, focusing on the fingers and wrist, and is connected to a program with the voice command option which controls the exercise rehabilitation in addition to monitoring the patient's progress.
Approach of Kinematic Control for a Nonholonomic Wheeled Robot using Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms	Conference Paper	Conference Paper	2017 International Conference and Workshop on Bioinspired Intelligence (IWOBI)	2017-7-10	Funchal. Portugal	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7985533/	The quest for an improvement in the quality of life of human beings directs the idea of integrating different areas of knowledge to solve problems that it is impossible to solve using traditional methods. The presented idea applies to the development of autonomous robotic systems; such as cars, wheelchairs, boats, and airplanes. In those cases, given a high level of autonomy can bring countless benefits to the quality of life of human beings. In this work, a reactive navigation hybrid controller for a nonholonomic mobile robot is presented. The controller was designed using the algorithm "Neuroevolution of Augmented Topologies" (NEAT) and trained using a developed simulator, which integrates different areas of knowledge such as control, system modeling and discrete-time simulation. The used methodology allowed to reach a level of autonomy for the vehicle, obtaining a stable controller with good performance in the analyzed scenario.
