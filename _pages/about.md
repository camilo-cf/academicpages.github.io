 Hi! I'm Camilo, a Mechatronic Engineer and PhD(c) at School of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) (São Paulo, Brazil). I've been always interested in mechatronics, robotics, control systems, signal processing and artificial intelligence. 
 
 I received my B.S. in Mechatronics Engineering at Military University Nueva Granada (UMNG) (Bogotá, Colombia) in 2014. There i worked on the GAV research laboratory from my third year of engineering (since 2012). In 2012, I worked in the image processing area with the Microsoft Kinect, using it as a sensor for a fuzzy control of  a multi-tank system ([Multi-tank fuzzy level controller system using Kinect](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6524599/) ), this work what was presented in the Conference of  Electronics, Robotics and Automotive Mechanics(CERMA) 2012. 
 
 Then in  2013, I was working in the [Design and construction of a prototype rehabilitation machine to hand and wrist](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6682785/) what is documented in the video below (click on the image).

  Also in 2013, I was working with *Hardware-in-the-Loop* (HIL) using the ST32F407VG embedded system for develop the work [State Feedback Control System of a Bar and Beam Using Emulated Hardware in the Loop (HIL)](https://www.praiseworthyprize.org/jsm/index.php?journal=ireaco&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=16586). Afterwards, I started to work with the AR Drone 2.0 and brain signals using the EEG headset Emotiv EPOC; at the same time I was developing the project called [Mathematical Modeling, Control and Simulation of a Suspension System with Energy Regeneration](https://www.praiseworthyprize.org/jsm/index.php?journal=ireme&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=17561)
  
  Next in 2014, I started to work in the GAV research group at UMNG as research assistant and also I got a half-time job developing math questions for the ICFES institute, questions that will be applied in the Colombian obligatory national exam. As research assistant I was involved in many projects, for example in the robotics area: [Design of a Bio-Inspired Equine Robot Prototype](https://www.praiseworthyprize.org/jsm/index.php?journal=ireme&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=18109) and robotics/image processing [Methodology for pest damage recognition in Begonia semperflorens(sugar flower) crop through image processing](http://www.redalyc.org/html/1699/169940048012/),  but overall in the development of a virtual laboratory for the use of PLCs and teaching of automation, work was is documented in [Development and interaction of a virtual laboratory assisted and controlled by PLC](http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?pid=S1909-83672016000100002&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es) (Video below (click on the image)).

  In July 2014, I got an offer for move to Brazil to UNICAMP, where I started my Master in Mechanical Engineering under the supervision of the Professor João Maurício Rosário. In my Master, I was working with brain signals, obtained with the EEG signals of the EEG headset Emotiv EPOC, my Master Thesis was using Evoked Potentials of the Visual Cortex, similar to P300. My Master Thesis in portuguese *[Domótica assistiva baseada na utilização de um sensor de EEG: estudo de caso](http://repositorio.unicamp.br/handle/REPOSIP/305445)* or in English: *Assistive domotics using an EEG sensor : study case*. Based on that work, I developed the paper *[Approach to Assistive Robotics Based on an EEG Sensor and a 6-DoF Robotic Arm](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Camilo_Caceres_Florez2/publication/307956503_Approach_to_Assistive_Robotics_Based_on_an_EEG_Sensor_and_a_6-DoF_Robotic_Arm/links/57d76c7b08ae601b39ac2de2/Approach-to-Assistive-Robotics-Based-on-an-EEG-Sensor-and-a-6-DoF-Robotic-Arm.pdf)*.

  In 2016, I received my Master diploma and I decided to keep working with the same advisor in the same Faculty, but more involved in the Mechatronics area. My interest in Artificial Intelligence and Mobile robotics started that year, due to that motivation I developed few research on my free time about mobile robots and AI, involving dynamics and kinematics. 
  
  In 2017, I presented the [Approach of Kinematic Control for a Nonholonomic Wheeled Robot using Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7985533/) work in the 2017 International Conference and Workshop on Bioinspired Intelligence (IWOBI) in Portugal, because of that paper I improved my proposal and added the simplified dynamics of the system for a new work, what is under evaluation. And also I developed the paper was is in the final publication stage, called *Design, Simulation, and Control of an Omnidirectional Mobile Robot*.
  
  Currently, I'm in the second year of my PhD. My PhD thesis is related with IoT/4.0 Industry concepts, operational research, Optimization and Healthcare systems. But I didn't leave my interest for data science, AI, automatic control (traditional and intelligent) and robotics; what I study in my free time.
