Hi! I’m Camilo, a Mechatronic Engineer, I'm studying a PhD at the School of Mechanical Engineering at University of Campinas (UNICAMP) (São Paulo, Brazil).

In this personal website, I pretend to introduce myself, my CV, my work (in academic/ research area), some interesting things/ideas, and also I'd like to post some information/codes/tutorials in blog format about my different areas of interest.

Between my interest topics are:
  * Mechatronics
  * Robotics
  * Dynamic Systems
  * Automatic and Intelligent Control
  * Data Science
  * Neural Networks
  * Genetic Algorithms
  * Evolutionary Computing
  * Artificial Intelligence
  * Signal and Image Processing
  * Optimization based in meta-heuristics
  * Bio-inspired algorithms
  * Operational Research
  * IoT and 4.0 Industry
  * Other random topics
  
 This video is an interesting example of how I mixed robotics, image processing and optimization. In this case I used  Python 3 and the robotics software simulation V-REP.
