Hi! I’m Camilo, a Mechatronic Engineer and PhD(c) at School of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) (São Paulo, Brazil). I’ve been always interested in mechatronics, robotics, control systems, signal processing and artificial intelligence.

I've been involved in research since 2012, I hold a B.E in Mechatronics Engineering (2014), a M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering (2016) and currently I'm trying to get a PhD in Mechanical Engineering with Mechatronics as main research direction.

In this personal website, I pretend to introduce myself, my work (in academic/ research area), the interesting things/ideas, also I'd like to post some information/codes/tutorials in blog format about my different areas of interest.

Between my my interests are topics like:

  * Mechatronics
  * Robotics
  * Dynamic Systems
  * Automatic and Intelligent Control
  * Data Science
  * Neural Networks
  * Genetic Algorithms
  * Evolutionary Computing
  * Artificial Intelligence
  * Signal and Image Processing
  * Optimization based in meta-heuristics
  * Bio-inspired algorithms
  * Operational Research
  * IoT and 4.0 Industry
  * Other random topics
